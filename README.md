# The Cohomology of Root Data
A talk given at the workshop "Automorphic Techniques in Arithmetic Geometry",
held at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin (08.-10.10.2018).

## Abstract
In a 1966 article, Jacques Tits studied the normalizer of a maximal split torus in a
split reductive group as an extension of the torus by the Weyl group. A natural
question to ask is, when does this sequence split?
Although Tits announced it in his article, a complete solution of this question (for
semsimple almost-simple groups) wasn’t published until 2017 (Adams-He).

In this talk, I will outline a different strategy to resolve this question by
computational means. Both practical questions (how to compute cohomology of Coxeter
groups efficiently) and theoretical questions (how to extend the results of finitely
many computations to infinitely many cases) will be addressed.
Partial results will be presented, and some evidence will be given for an analogue
of Nakaoka‘s theorem concerning (co-)homological stability of symmetric groups for
nontrivial coefficients.
